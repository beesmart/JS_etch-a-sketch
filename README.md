A JavaScript "etch-a-sketch" app - Task outline from Odin Project.com.

> Changelog 
  =========

>> Version 0.1 - 21/10/14
   ----------------------
>>> Dynamically created grid (30x30)
>>> User can customise grid size and reset
>>> Hover and flashing functions

> Future Updates
  ==============

>> Grid needs to be made responsive
>> Some heavy CSS styling needs to be applied
>> Give user an option to change brush or background colours
>> From Odin: (Optional) Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example), have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it, so only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
